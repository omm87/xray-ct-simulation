# xray-ct-simulation
This project focuses on simulating the X-ray CT imaging process using MATLAB, incorporating forward projection, backprojection, and filtered backprojection techniques to reconstruct images from projection data. By conducting this simulation, the project aims to enhance the understanding of CT image reconstruction techniques, demonstrate the effects of filtering on reconstruction quality, and provide a platform for experimenting with different parameters in the CT imaging process.
